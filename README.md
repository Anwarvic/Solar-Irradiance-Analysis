# Solar Irradiance Analysis

This repo contains my analysis for the solar irradiance of some European city (Don't remember which city is it exactly) which can be used to implement some solar panels to produce electricity for the city. The data is provided as an excel file called "solar_irradiance_original.csv" which is a ten-year data of the 24-hour solar irradiance over a certain area in that European city from 1998 till 2009.

My Analysis is done using **MatLab**, but my visualization is done using Microsoft Excel. 

My analysis consists of three steps:

- Cleaning the data: where I removed the entries that has no solar irradiance (night period). After removing, I sorted the data and split them hours.
- Analyzing the data: which I have deduced that:
  - When is the time when we can get the best out of these solar panels. 
  - How much the average irradiance we can get each day over the whole year.
  - what is the best month/day/hour to produce electricity.
- Visualizing the data: these are some of the visualization that I have provided:

The following image is about the distribution of average irradiance in Winter:
